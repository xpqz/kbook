    "K-code tends to be built up using short verb definitions. You will have noticed by now that you build up functionality from the right by applying verbs and adverbs, and most of the time there is no need for statement separation. However, if you do need multiple statements, you simply separate them with semicolon. Some ks (not all) also allow statements to be laid out over multiple lines. ngn/k is amongst those that do allow for this, but only if you are executing a _file_ of code, and under the small proviso that the final closing `}` must not sit on its own line. In other words, you can't use multi-line verbs in the repl, and as the jupyter-kernel behind this book uses the repl, we can't show this feature in action."
