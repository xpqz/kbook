# What about k?

This is the beginnings of an introduction to the k language, primarily in its open source form.

It's very much a work in progress, and not completed. It's written as a [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org), with the kernel for [ngn/k](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k) available [here](https://github.com/xpqz/ngnk_kernel)

You can view it in its current form on https://xpqz.github.io/kbook

I've written a few other things you may be interested in, too:

* [Learning APL](https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl)
* [APL Cultivations](https://xpqz.github.io/cultivations)
